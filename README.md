## How it works
gpt-4 turbo is used to parse the query and generate [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) code, which is then placed on a canvas, and stitched together using [FFMPEG](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)

### Inspiration
Basically getting a solution to your answer powered by wolfram alpha and Latex rather than searching on YouTube or StackOverflow

### Challenges we ran into
General OpenAI outages from time to time plus knowledge gaps, syntax errors, wrong dependencies being on different systems.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have a proof of concept! This tool can actually be commercialized and be put to good use. both for children in school to adults in universities and colleges.

### What we learned
We learned to communicate, became good friends and had a lot of fun.

### What's next for VisiMath
Hopefully get it working at a commercial product level by extensive testing and improving the model or fine-tuning the model it works on
